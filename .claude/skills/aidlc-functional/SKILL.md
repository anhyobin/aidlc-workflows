description: AIDLC Functional Design -- designs per-unit business logic, domain models, validation rules, data flows, and business rules through structured question-answer cycles. Produces technology-agnostic artifacts for a specific implementation unit. Trigger when the user requests functional design for a named unit, wants to design business logic or domain models, asks about validation rules or data flows for a unit, or enters the Construction phase's functional design stage. Keywords -- "functional design", "business logic", "domain model", "validation rules", "data flow" combined with a specific unit name. Do NOT trigger for NFR/performance design, infrastructure mapping, code generation, app-level architecture, unit decomposition, requirements analysis, or status checks.

# AIDLC Functional Design (Per Unit)

You are executing the **Functional Design** stage of AIDLC Construction for unit **$ARGUMENTS**.

This stage produces technology-agnostic business logic artifacts through deep Q&A with the team.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify:
1. Read `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` -- confirm this unit exists and execution-plan.md shows this stage as EXECUTE
2. If prerequisites are not met, stop and explain what is missing

## Procedure

### Step 1 -- Load Unit Context

Read all relevant Inception artifacts:
- `aidlc-docs/inception/unit-of-work.md` -- find the entry for unit **$ARGUMENTS**
- `aidlc-docs/inception/story-maps/` -- load story maps related to this unit
- Any other Inception artifacts referenced by this unit

Summarize what you understand about this unit's scope, responsibilities, and boundaries.

### Step 2 -- Create Design Plan

Create a checkbox plan covering all areas that need functional design decisions:
- [ ] Business logic flows
- [ ] Domain model and entities
- [ ] Validation rules and business constraints
- [ ] Data flow and integration points
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Frontend components (if this is a UI unit)

Save the plan to:
`aidlc-docs/construction/plans/$ARGUMENTS-functional-design-plan.md`

### Step 3 -- Generate Question File

Create the question file at:
`aidlc-docs/construction/$ARGUMENTS/functional-design-questions.md`

Organize questions into these categories. Ask for ALL ambiguous areas -- over-asking beats under-asking.

```markdown
# Functional Design Questions: $ARGUMENTS

## Business Logic & Domain Model
- Q1: [question]
  [Answer]:
- Q2: [question]
  [Answer]:

## Business Rules & Validation
- Q1: [question]
  [Answer]:

## Data Flow & Integration Points
- Q1: [question]
  [Answer]:

## Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Q1: [question]
  [Answer]:

## Frontend Components (if applicable)
- Q1: [question]
  [Answer]:
```

Rules for question generation:
- Default to asking when there is ANY ambiguity
- Be specific -- reference concrete entities, flows, and scenarios from the Inception artifacts
- Include "why" questions, not just "what" -- understanding intent prevents design mistakes
- Each question should be independently answerable (no dependencies between questions)

Present the question file path to the team and explain what you need answered.

### Step 4 -- GATE: Wait for Team Answers

Stop and wait. Tell the team:
> "Question file generated: `aidlc-docs/construction/$ARGUMENTS/functional-design-questions.md`
> Please write your answers after each `[Answer]:` tag. Let us know when complete."

Do NOT proceed until the team signals that answers are ready.

### Step 5 -- Answer Analysis

When answers arrive:
1. Read the completed question file
2. Flag any vague answers: look for "depends", "maybe", "TBD", "not sure", empty answers
3. If vague answers exist, create a follow-up clarification file:
   `aidlc-docs/construction/$ARGUMENTS/functional-design-clarifications.md`
4. Present clarifications and wait again
5. Repeat until ALL answers are concrete and actionable

### Step 6 -- Generate Design Artifacts

With all answers resolved, generate artifacts in:
`aidlc-docs/construction/$ARGUMENTS/functional-design/`

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `business-logic-model.md` | Business logic flows, process descriptions, decision trees |
| `business-rules.md` | Validation rules, business constraints, invariants |
| `domain-entities.md` | Domain model, entity relationships, data structures |
| `frontend-components.md` | UI component specifications (only for UI units) |

Each artifact must:
- Trace back to specific answers from the Q&A
- Be technology-agnostic (no specific frameworks, databases, or services)
- Be detailed enough for the next stage (NFR) to assess non-functional needs

### Step 7 -- GATE: Approve & Continue

Present a summary of all generated artifacts with key decisions highlighted.

Ask the team:
> "Functional Design is complete. Please review and choose:
> 1. **Approve & Continue** -- proceed to NFR stage
> 2. **Request Changes** -- let us know what needs to be modified"

If approved, update `aidlc-state.md` to reflect functional design completion for this unit.
