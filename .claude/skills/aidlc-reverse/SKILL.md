description: AIDLC Reverse Engineering -- analyzes an EXISTING codebase (brownfield only) to generate 8 design artifacts covering business overview, architecture, code structure, APIs, components, tech stack, dependencies, and code quality. Trigger for "analyze this codebase", "understand existing code", "reverse engineer", "what does this code do", "document existing system", or any brownfield project after detect. This is NOT detect (detect only scans file types; reverse produces deep analysis). NOT app-design (reverse reads existing code; app-design creates new architecture). Requires Brownfield: true in state.

# AIDLC Reverse Engineering

You are an AIDLC Analyst performing Reverse Engineering on an existing codebase. This stage is for **brownfield projects only** -- where source code already exists and must be understood before new work begins.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify:
1. `/aidlc-detect` has been completed (aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md exists)
2. State file shows `Brownfield: true`

If prerequisites are not met, inform the team and recommend the correct skill.

## Step 1: Multi-Dimensional Discovery

Perform a comprehensive scan across ALL of these dimensions:

### Packages & Modules
- Application packages (main source, features, domains)
- CDK / Infrastructure packages
- Model / Schema definitions
- Client libraries / SDKs
- Test packages and coverage

### Business Context
- Purpose of the system (infer from code, README, comments)
- Core business transactions / workflows
- Domain model and bounded contexts
- Business dictionary / terminology

### Infrastructure
- CDK constructs and stacks
- Terraform modules and resources
- CloudFormation templates
- Deployment scripts and pipelines
- Container definitions (Dockerfile, docker-compose)

### Build Systems
- Build tool configuration (Maven, Gradle, npm, etc.)
- Dependency management
- Build scripts and automation
- CI/CD pipeline definitions

### Services & Resources
- Lambda functions (handlers, triggers, configurations)
- Container services (ECS, EKS, Fargate)
- API definitions (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)
- Data stores (DynamoDB, RDS, S3, ElastiCache, etc.)
- Message queues and event buses
- Authentication and authorization

### Code Quality
- Programming languages and versions
- Test coverage and testing frameworks
- Linting and formatting configuration
- Identified technical debt
- Design patterns in use
- Code organization patterns

## Step 2: Generate 8 Artifacts

Create all artifacts in `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/`:

### 2.1 business-overview.md
- Context diagram (Mermaid) showing the system's place in the broader ecosystem
- Business description: what the system does, who uses it, why it exists
- Core business transactions with flow descriptions
- Business dictionary: domain-specific terms and their definitions

### 2.2 architecture.md
- System overview with architectural style (microservices, monolith, serverless, etc.)
- Architecture diagrams (Mermaid): component diagram, deployment diagram
- Data flow diagrams showing how data moves through the system
- Integration points with external systems
- Key architectural decisions (inferred from code)

### 2.3 code-structure.md
- Build system analysis (tool, configuration, multi-module structure)
- Class/module diagrams (Mermaid) for core packages
- Design patterns identified with examples
- File inventory: count by type, organization pattern
- Entry points and bootstrapping

### 2.4 api-documentation.md
- REST endpoints: method, path, request/response types, authentication
- Internal APIs: service-to-service interfaces
- Data models: request/response schemas, database entities
- API versioning and deprecation patterns

### 2.5 component-inventory.md
Categorize all packages/modules by type:
- **Core**: Business logic, domain models
- **API**: Controllers, handlers, routes
- **Data**: Repositories, data access, migrations
- **Infrastructure**: CDK, Terraform, deployment
- **Integration**: External service clients
- **Shared**: Utilities, common libraries
- **Test**: Test suites, fixtures, mocks

### 2.6 technology-stack.md
- Languages: name, version, usage scope
- Frameworks: name, version, purpose
- Infrastructure: AWS services, configurations
- Build & Test: tools, CI/CD, testing frameworks
- Development: linting, formatting, IDE configs

### 2.7 dependencies.md
- Internal dependency diagram (Mermaid) showing module relationships
- External dependencies with versions (grouped by purpose)
- Dependency health: outdated packages, security concerns
- Circular dependency identification

### 2.8 code-quality-assessment.md
- Test coverage analysis: what is tested, what is not
- Linting/formatting: tools in use, consistency
- Technical debt inventory: specific items with severity
- Pattern consistency: where patterns break down
- Recommendations: prioritized improvement opportunities

## Step 3: Create Timestamp File

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/analysis-metadata.md`:

```markdown
# Reverse Engineering Analysis Metadata

- **Analysis Date**: [ISO 8601]
- **Workspace Root**: [path]
- **Files Analyzed**: [total count]
- **Source Files**: [count by language]
- **Build Files**: [count]
- **Infrastructure Files**: [count]
- **Test Files**: [count]
```

## Step 4: Update State

Update `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md`:
- Mark `[x] Reverse Engineering` in the checklist
- Set Current Stage to `Reverse Engineering -> Pending Approval`

Log to `aidlc-docs/audit.md`:
```markdown
## Audit Log

| Timestamp | Stage | Action | Details |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| [ISO 8601] | Reverse Engineering | COMPLETED | 8 artifacts generated in inception/reverse-engineering/ |
```

## Step 5: Present Completion

Present to the team:

```
=== AIDLC Reverse Engineering Complete ===

Artifacts Generated:
1. business-overview.md -- [brief summary]
2. architecture.md -- [brief summary]
3. code-structure.md -- [brief summary]
4. api-documentation.md -- [brief summary]
5. component-inventory.md -- [brief summary]
6. technology-stack.md -- [brief summary]
7. dependencies.md -- [brief summary]
8. code-quality-assessment.md -- [brief summary]

Key Findings:
- [Top 3-5 important discoveries about the codebase]

Location: aidlc-docs/inception/reverse-engineering/
```

**APPROVAL GATE**: Wait for the team to review artifacts and explicitly approve before proceeding. Do NOT suggest or start the next stage until approval is given. When approved, recommend `/aidlc-requirements` as the next step.
