description: AIDLC Infrastructure Design -- maps logical components to REAL AWS services (Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS, etc.) and produces deployment architecture, CI/CD pipelines, networking, monitoring, and cost analysis for a specific unit. Trigger for "infrastructure for [unit]", "AWS services", "deployment architecture", "which services to use", "CI/CD pipeline", "map to AWS", or after functional/NFR design approval. This is NOT NFR (NFR designs logical patterns; infra maps them to physical AWS services with specific configurations). NOT app-design (app-design is system-wide logical architecture; infra is per-unit physical deployment). Takes a unit name argument.

# AIDLC Infrastructure Design (Per Unit)

You are executing the **Infrastructure Design** stage of AIDLC Construction for unit **$ARGUMENTS**.

This stage maps the logical components from NFR Design to real infrastructure services and produces deployment architecture.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify:
1. Read `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` -- confirm functional design is complete for unit **$ARGUMENTS**
2. NFR design is recommended but not strictly required -- if skipped, note that infrastructure choices are based solely on functional design
3. If functional design is not complete, stop: "Functional Design must be completed first. Run `/aidlc-functional $ARGUMENTS`."

## Procedure

### Step 1 -- Load Design Artifacts

Read all preceding design artifacts for this unit:
- `aidlc-docs/construction/$ARGUMENTS/functional-design/` -- business logic, domain model, rules
- `aidlc-docs/construction/$ARGUMENTS/nfr-requirements/` -- NFR targets, tech stack decisions (if exists)
- `aidlc-docs/construction/$ARGUMENTS/nfr-design/` -- patterns, logical components (if exists)

Summarize the key infrastructure-relevant decisions:
- What logical components need physical mapping?
- What are the performance/scalability/availability targets?
- What tech stack decisions constrain infrastructure choices?

### Step 2 -- Create Infrastructure Design Plan

Create a checkbox plan covering infrastructure design areas relevant to THIS unit.

Save to: `aidlc-docs/construction/plans/$ARGUMENTS-infrastructure-design-plan.md`

### Step 3 -- Generate Question File

Create the question file at:
`aidlc-docs/construction/$ARGUMENTS/infrastructure-design-questions.md`

Only include categories relevant to this unit. These are inspirational -- adapt to what the unit actually needs:

```markdown
# Infrastructure Design Questions: $ARGUMENTS

## Compute
<!-- Lambda, ECS, EKS, EC2, App Runner, Fargate... -->
- Q1: [question]
  [Answer]:

## Storage & Database
<!-- S3, DynamoDB, RDS, Aurora, ElastiCache, EFS... -->
- Q1: [question]
  [Answer]:

## Networking & API
<!-- VPC, API Gateway, ALB/NLB, CloudFront, Route 53... -->
- Q1: [question]
  [Answer]:

## Messaging & Integration
<!-- SQS, SNS, EventBridge, Step Functions, Kinesis... -->
- Q1: [question]
  [Answer]:

## Monitoring & Observability
<!-- CloudWatch, X-Ray, OpenTelemetry, dashboards, alarms... -->
- Q1: [question]
  [Answer]:

## Cost Considerations
<!-- Reserved capacity, savings plans, cost allocation, budget limits... -->
- Q1: [question]
  [Answer]:

## Existing Infrastructure
<!-- Shared resources, cross-unit dependencies, VPC peering... -->
- Q1: [question]
  [Answer]:
```

Rules for question generation:
- Reference specific logical components from NFR Design and ask which physical service to map them to
- Include cost vs. performance trade-off questions
- Ask about existing infrastructure that can be reused
- Ask about deployment preferences (IaC tool, CI/CD pipeline, environments)
- Be specific about AWS services -- name concrete options, do not ask open-ended "what service?"

Present the question file path and explain what you need.

### Step 4 -- GATE: Wait for Answers

> "Infrastructure Design question file generated: `aidlc-docs/construction/$ARGUMENTS/infrastructure-design-questions.md`
> Please write your answers after each `[Answer]:` tag. Let us know when complete."

Do NOT proceed until answers are ready.

### Step 5 -- Answer Analysis & Clarification

1. Read completed answers
2. Flag vague, incomplete, or contradictory answers
3. Check for consistency with NFR requirements (e.g., "chose single-AZ but NFR requires 99.9% uptime")
4. If issues exist, create: `aidlc-docs/construction/$ARGUMENTS/infrastructure-design-clarifications.md`
5. Wait for resolution, repeat until all answers are concrete

### Step 6 -- Generate Infrastructure Design Artifacts

Generate in `aidlc-docs/construction/$ARGUMENTS/infrastructure-design/`:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `infrastructure-design.md` | Physical service mapping (logical component -> AWS service), configuration details, sizing, service interactions |
| `deployment-architecture.md` | Deployment topology, environments (dev/staging/prod), IaC approach, CI/CD pipeline design, rollback strategy |
| `shared-infrastructure.md` | Only if this unit uses or creates shared resources -- VPC, shared databases, common APIs, cross-unit dependencies |

Each artifact must:
- Map every logical component to a specific AWS service with rationale
- Include configuration details (instance types, capacity units, retention periods, etc.)
- Document cost implications and optimization opportunities
- Reference NFR requirements to justify infrastructure choices
- Identify shared vs. unit-specific resources clearly

### Step 7 -- GATE: Approve & Continue

Present a summary with an architecture overview highlighting:
- Key service choices and their rationale
- Cost estimate summary (if available)
- Deployment strategy
- Any risks or trade-offs

Ask the team:
> "Infrastructure Design is complete. Please review and choose:
> 1. **Request Changes** -- let us know what needs to be modified
> 2. **Approve & Continue to Code Generation** -- proceed to code generation stage"

If approved, update `aidlc-state.md` to reflect infrastructure design completion for this unit.
