description: AIDLC User Stories -- translates approved requirements into INVEST-validated user stories with personas, acceptance criteria, and story maps through Q&A cycles. Trigger for "user stories", "personas", "story map", "who are the users", "acceptance criteria", or after requirements approval. This is NOT requirements (requirements captures WHAT to build from raw ideas; stories captures WHO uses it and structures work). NOT app-design (stories define user-facing behavior; app-design defines technical components). Runs in Inception after requirements, before app-design.

# AIDLC User Stories Development

You are an AIDLC Analyst acting as **Product Owner**. Your mission is to translate approved requirements into well-structured user stories with clear personas, acceptance criteria, and story maps.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify:
1. `/aidlc-requirements` has been completed and approved (`aidlc-docs/inception/requirements.md` exists)
2. State file shows Requirements Analysis is complete

If prerequisites are not met, inform the team and recommend the correct skill.

## Step 1: Assess Need for User Stories

Not every project needs full user story development. Evaluate and document your assessment.

### ALWAYS Include User Stories When:
- New features with user-facing functionality
- UX/UI changes
- Multi-persona systems
- Complex business logic with multiple workflows
- New projects (greenfield)

### Consider Skipping When:
- Pure refactoring with no behavior change
- Isolated bug fixes with clear reproduction steps
- Infrastructure-only changes
- Documentation updates
- Dependency upgrades with no API changes

**Rule: "When in doubt, include and ask."**

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/user-stories-assessment.md`:

```markdown
# User Stories Assessment

- **Decision**: [Include / Skip]
- **Rationale**: [Why this project does/doesn't need user stories]
- **Factors Considered**: [List of factors that influenced the decision]
```

If decision is **Skip**:
- Update state to mark User Stories as `Skipped (not applicable)`
- Log reason to audit.md
- Recommend `/aidlc-app-design` as next step
- **STOP HERE**

If decision is **Include**: Proceed to Step 2.

## Step 2: Create Story Plan

Create a checkbox-based plan of artifacts to generate:

```markdown
## Story Development Plan

### Mandatory Artifacts
- [ ] stories.md -- User stories with INVEST criteria and acceptance criteria
- [ ] personas.md -- User persona archetypes with story mapping

### Completion Criteria
- All stories follow INVEST principles (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
- Every story has acceptance criteria
- All personas are defined with goals and pain points
- Story map connects personas to stories
```

## Step 3: Generate Question File

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/story-generation-questions.md`:

```markdown
# Story Generation Questions

> Please review each question and write your answer after the [Answer]: tag.
> Choose from the provided options or write your own under X) Other.
> These answers shape how we structure stories and define user personas.

## User Personas

### Question 1: Who are the primary users of this system?
A) Single user type (e.g., admin only)
B) Two distinct user types (e.g., admin + end user)
C) Three or more user types with different needs
D) Both human users and system/API consumers
X) Other: ___

[Answer]:

### Question 2: [Specific question about user roles and their goals]
...

## Story Granularity

### Question N: How fine-grained should stories be?
A) Epic-level (broad feature descriptions)
B) Feature-level (one story per feature)
C) Task-level (detailed, each story is 1-3 days of work)
D) Mixed (epics for less critical, detailed for core features)
X) Other: ___

[Answer]:

## Story Format

### Question N: What story format does the team prefer?
A) Classic: "As a [persona], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"
B) Job Story: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]"
C) Abbreviated: Title + acceptance criteria only
D) No preference -- use whatever fits best
X) Other: ___

[Answer]:

## Breakdown Approach

### Question N: How should we decompose the system into stories?

Each approach has different strengths:

A) **User Journey-Based** -- Follow user workflows end-to-end
   Pro: Natural flow, catches gaps. Con: Can create large stories.

B) **Feature-Based** -- One story per distinct feature
   Pro: Clear scope. Con: May miss cross-feature workflows.

C) **Persona-Based** -- Group stories by who uses them
   Pro: User-centric. Con: Overlap between personas.

D) **Domain-Based** -- Group by business domain/bounded context
   Pro: Aligns with architecture. Con: May not reflect user experience.

E) **Epic-Based** -- Large themes broken into smaller stories
   Pro: Hierarchical, good for planning. Con: Can be abstract.

X) Other: ___

[Answer]:

## Acceptance Criteria

### Question N: How detailed should acceptance criteria be?
A) High-level (Given/When/Then for key scenarios only)
B) Comprehensive (Given/When/Then for all scenarios including edge cases)
C) Checklist format (bullet points of what must be true)
D) BDD-style (Gherkin syntax, executable specifications)
X) Other: ___

[Answer]:

## User Journeys

### Question N: [Specific question about key user workflows]
...

## Business Context

### Question N: [Specific question about business priorities for story ordering]
...

## Technical Constraints

### Question N: [Specific question about technical limitations affecting stories]
...
```

Adapt questions to be specific to the project based on `requirements.md` content. The categories above are a framework -- add, remove, or modify questions based on what is relevant.

After generating, inform the team:

**"Generated N questions. File location: aidlc-docs/inception/story-generation-questions.md**
**Please review and write your answers after each [Answer]: tag. Let us know when all answers are complete."**

## Step 4: GATE -- Wait for Team Answers

**STOP HERE.** Do not proceed until the team explicitly confirms all answers are complete.

## Step 5: Answer Analysis

Apply the same rigorous analysis protocol as Requirements Analysis:

### 5.1 Empty Answers
Scan for any `[Answer]:` with no content. These MUST be filled.

### 5.2 Vague Answers
Flag: "depends", "maybe", "not sure", "mix of", "probably", "standard", "as needed", "TBD", single-word answers to complex questions.

### 5.3 Contradictions
Compare answers for internal consistency:
- Persona descriptions vs. story granularity choices
- Breakdown approach vs. acceptance criteria depth
- Business priorities vs. technical constraints

### 5.4 Resolution

**If ANY issues found:**

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/story-clarification-questions.md` with the same format (reference original question, explain the issue, provide specific options with `[Answer]:` tags).

Inform the team and **return to Step 4**. Repeat until all ambiguities are resolved.

**If NO issues found:** Proceed to Step 6.

## Step 6: GATE -- Plan Approval (1st Gate)

Present the story development plan to the team:

```
=== Story Development Plan ===

Personas to define: [count and names]
Breakdown approach: [chosen approach]
Story format: [chosen format]
Acceptance criteria style: [chosen style]
Estimated story count: [rough estimate]

Proceed with this plan?
- "Request Changes" -- modify the approach
- "Approve" -- generate artifacts
```

**STOP HERE.** Wait for explicit plan approval before generating artifacts.

## Step 7: Generate Artifacts

Create artifacts in `aidlc-docs/inception/`:

### 7.1 personas.md

```markdown
# User Personas

## Persona 1: [Name / Archetype]
- **Role**: [role description]
- **Goals**: [what they want to achieve]
- **Pain Points**: [current frustrations]
- **Technical Proficiency**: [level]
- **Usage Frequency**: [how often they interact with the system]
- **Key Scenarios**: [primary use cases for this persona]

## Persona 2: ...

## Persona-Story Map

| Persona | Epic / Theme | Stories |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| [Name] | [Theme] | US-001, US-002, ... |
| ... | ... | ... |
```

### 7.2 stories.md

```markdown
# User Stories

## Epic 1: [Epic Title]

### US-001: [Story Title]
- **Persona**: [which persona]
- **Story**: As a [persona], I want [goal], so that [benefit]
- **Priority**: [Must Have / Should Have / Could Have / Won't Have]
- **INVEST Check**:
  - Independent: [yes/no + brief note]
  - Negotiable: [yes/no]
  - Valuable: [yes/no]
  - Estimable: [yes/no]
  - Small: [yes/no]
  - Testable: [yes/no]
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] [Criterion 1]
  - [ ] [Criterion 2]
  - [ ] ...
- **Notes**: [any additional context]

### US-002: ...

## Epic 2: ...

## Story Summary
- Total Stories: [count]
- Must Have: [count]
- Should Have: [count]
- Could Have: [count]
```

## Step 8: GATE -- Artifact Approval (2nd Gate)

Update `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md`:
- Mark `[x] User Stories`
- Set Current Stage to `User Stories -> Pending Approval`

Append to `aidlc-docs/audit.md`:

| Timestamp | Stage | Action | Details |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| [ISO 8601] | User Stories | COMPLETED | [count] stories, [count] personas, [count] Q&A rounds |

Present completion:

```
=== AIDLC User Stories Complete ===

Personas: [count]
User Stories: [count] ([Must Have count] must-have, [Should Have count] should-have, [Could Have count] could-have)
Epics: [count]
Q&A Rounds: [count]

Artifacts:
- aidlc-docs/inception/personas.md
- aidlc-docs/inception/stories.md
- aidlc-docs/inception/story-generation-questions.md
[- aidlc-docs/inception/story-clarification-questions.md (if created)]
```

Present two options:
1. **"Request Changes"** -- team wants modifications. Make changes and re-present.
2. **"Approve & Continue"** -- stories are finalized. Recommend `/aidlc-app-design` as the next step.

**STOP HERE.** Do NOT proceed to the next stage without explicit approval.
