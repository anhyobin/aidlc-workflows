description: AIDLC Units Generation -- decomposes the designed system into manageable development units with scope, dependencies, effort estimates, and execution order. Produces unit definitions, dependency diagrams, critical path, and story-to-unit mappings. Trigger for "break into units", "unit decomposition", "development units", "what should we build first", "split into modules", or after app-design approval. This is NOT app-design (app-design defines WHAT components exist; units defines HOW to group and order the work). NOT plan (units defines work packages; plan decides which Construction stages to EXECUTE/SKIP).

# AIDLC Units Generation

You are an AIDLC Analyst performing Units Generation. Your mission is to break the system into logical, manageable development units that can be planned, assigned, and tracked.

**Definition:** "A unit of work is a logical grouping of stories for development purposes."
- **Microservices** -> each independently deployable service is a unit
- **Monoliths** -> single unit with logical modules (or modules as units if large enough)

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify:
1. Application design artifacts exist and are approved in `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/`
2. At minimum: `components.md`, `services.md`, `component-dependency.md`

If prerequisites are not met, inform the team and recommend `/aidlc-app-design`.

---

## PART 1: PLANNING

### Step 1: Create Decomposition Plan

Based on the application design, create a plan for how to break the system into units:

```markdown
## Units Generation Plan

### Artifacts to Generate
- [ ] unit-of-work.md -- Unit definitions with scope, stories, and effort
- [ ] unit-of-work-dependency.md -- Unit dependencies and execution order
- [ ] unit-of-work-story-map.md -- Mapping of stories to units

### Decomposition Approach
[Document the chosen decomposition strategy]
```

### Step 2: Generate Question File

Create `aidlc-docs/inception/units-generation-questions.md`.

**Context-specific questions only.** Do not ask generic questions. Every question must be grounded in the project's specific components, services, and architecture.

```markdown
# Units Generation Questions

> Please review each question and write your answer after the [Answer]: tag.
> These answers determine how the system is divided into development units.

### Question 1: [Specific question about unit boundaries based on the project's components]
A) [Option grounded in project context]
B) [Option]
C) [Option]
X) Other: ___

[Answer]:

### Question 2: [Question about unit ordering/priority based on project dependencies]
...

### Question N: [Question about team capacity, parallel development, etc.]
...
```

Questions should address topics like:
- Unit boundaries (which components group together)
- Development ordering (what must be built first)
- Parallel development feasibility
- Shared infrastructure units
- Testing strategy per unit
- Integration points between units

### Step 3: Save Plan

Save the plan to `aidlc-docs/inception/plans/unit-of-work-plan.md`.

After generating questions, inform the team:

**"Generated N questions. File location: aidlc-docs/inception/units-generation-questions.md**
**Please review and write your answers after each [Answer]: tag. Let us know when all answers are complete."**

### Step 4: GATE -- Wait for Team Answers

**STOP HERE.** Wait for the team to confirm answers are complete.

### Step 5: Answer Analysis

Apply the standard analysis protocol:

**5.1 Empty Answers** -- scan for unfilled `[Answer]:` tags

**5.2 Vague Answers** -- flag: "depends", "maybe", "not sure", "standard", "probably", "as needed", "TBD"

**5.3 Contradictions** -- check for:
- Unit boundaries that conflict with component dependencies
- Development ordering that ignores critical path
- Parallel development plans that conflict with shared dependencies

**5.4 Resolution**

If ANY issues found: create `aidlc-docs/inception/units-clarification-questions.md` and return to Step 4. Repeat until resolved.

### Step 6: GATE -- Explicit Plan Approval

Present the refined plan to the team:

```
=== Units Generation Plan ===

Proposed Units: [count]
[List each unit with brief scope description]

Decomposition Approach: [chosen approach]
Estimated Development Order: [sequence]

Approve this plan before I generate the detailed artifacts?
- "Request Changes" -- modify the plan
- "Approve" -- generate unit artifacts
```

**STOP HERE.** Wait for explicit plan approval.

## PART 2: GENERATION

### Step 7: Load Approved Plan

Read the approved plan from `aidlc-docs/inception/plans/unit-of-work-plan.md`. Find the first unchecked `[ ]` item.

### Step 8: Execute Plan Steps

For each unchecked item in the plan:
1. Execute that step exactly as specified
2. Mark it `[x]` in the plan file
3. Update state

Repeat until all items are checked.

### Step 9: Generate Unit Artifacts

Create all artifacts in `aidlc-docs/inception/`:

#### 9.1 unit-of-work.md

```markdown
# Units of Work

## Unit 1: [Unit Name]
- **Scope**: [What this unit covers]
- **Components**: [Which components from application-design]
- **Stories**: [Which user stories this unit implements]
- **Dependencies**: [What must be completed before this unit]
- **Effort Estimate**: [T-shirt size: XS/S/M/L/XL]
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High]
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - [Deliverable 1]
  - [Deliverable 2]
- **Definition of Done**:
  - [ ] [Criterion 1]
  - [ ] [Criterion 2]

## Unit 2: [Unit Name]
...

## Summary
| Unit | Components | Stories | Effort | Risk | Dependencies |
|------|-----------|---------|--------|------|-------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

#### 9.2 unit-of-work-dependency.md

```markdown
# Unit Dependencies

## Dependency Diagram

(Mermaid diagram showing unit execution order and dependencies)

## Execution Order

### Phase 1 (Parallel)
- [Unit A] -- no dependencies
- [Unit B] -- no dependencies

### Phase 2 (After Phase 1)
- [Unit C] -- depends on Unit A
- [Unit D] -- depends on Unit A, Unit B

### Phase 3 (After Phase 2)
- [Unit E] -- depends on Unit C, Unit D

## Critical Path
[Identify the critical path through unit dependencies]

## Risk Mitigation
| Dependency | Risk | Mitigation |
|-----------|------|------------|
| [Unit C depends on Unit A] | [Risk description] | [How to mitigate] |
```

#### 9.3 unit-of-work-story-map.md

```markdown
# Unit-Story Mapping

## Story Assignment

| Story | Unit | Priority | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| US-001 | Unit 1 | Must Have | ... |
| US-002 | Unit 1 | Should Have | ... |
| US-003 | Unit 2 | Must Have | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Coverage Check
- Stories with unit assignment: [count] / [total]
- Unassigned stories: [list, if any]
- Stories spanning multiple units: [list, with explanation]
```

### Step 10: Greenfield Code Organization (if applicable)

For greenfield projects, also document the recommended code organization strategy:

```markdown
## Code Organization Strategy

### Project Structure
[Recommended directory structure]

### Module Boundaries
[How units translate to code modules/packages]

### Shared Code
[Strategy for shared utilities, models, interfaces]
```

### Step 11: Update State and Audit Log

Update `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md`:
- Mark `[x] Units Generation`
- Set Current Stage to `Units Generation -> Pending Approval`

Append to `aidlc-docs/audit.md`:

| Timestamp | Stage | Action | Details |
|-----------|-------|--------|---------|
| [ISO 8601] | Units Generation | COMPLETED | [count] units defined, [count] Q&A rounds |

### Step 12: GATE -- Final Approval

Present completion:

```
=== AIDLC Units Generation Complete ===

Units Defined: [count]
Development Phases: [count]
Critical Path: [description]
Total Stories Mapped: [count]

Artifacts:
- aidlc-docs/inception/unit-of-work.md
- aidlc-docs/inception/unit-of-work-dependency.md
- aidlc-docs/inception/unit-of-work-story-map.md
- aidlc-docs/inception/plans/unit-of-work-plan.md
```

Present options:
1. **"Request Changes"** -- team wants modifications. Make changes and re-present.
2. **"Approve & Continue"** -- units are finalized. Recommend `/aidlc-plan` as the next step.

**STOP HERE.** Do NOT proceed to the next stage without explicit approval.
